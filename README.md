This project has an improved firmware for the build.

## Improvements

This fork of TeaBot includes the following improvements:

- Better UI: The user interface has been enhanced to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
- Interruptible Tea Making: The tea making process can now be interrupted by performing a long press on the button.
- Automatic Start: The TeaBot will automatically start the tea making process after a 2-second delay, eliminating the need for double-tapping the button.
- Regular Dipping: The TeaBot will dip the tea bag every 2 minutes to ensure proper infusion.
